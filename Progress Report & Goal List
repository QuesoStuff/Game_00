# Game_00

January 20th 2023
- Week 01 Summary

Finally got back into the swing of things of the game dev. I have come to realize that the issue with the diagonal shooting is not with my code implementation but a hardware design restriction with the keyboard I am testing with (Rollover Keyboard issue).
In response, I have decided to keep moving and shooting 4-directional for the time being. 

I was also able to get the charge time to work for shooting in the game, the blinking now occurs when ready to shoot, and another change when a shot has been fired. I also adjusted the explosion function so that the dash explosion is a bit more consistent, the duration is relevant to the dash speed sound

What to accomplish this week (jan 20-27 2023)
** WEEKEND GOALS (20-23)
- clean up code , delete comments structure it better
- documentation (design pattern & implementation choices)
- clean up code of Debug.Log() they slow down performance 
- research and start profiling game performance/framerate to see how to make the game run smoothly
* GENERAL
- figure out a file save system with high score mini-game approach
- generalize save feature
- add bullet shot count in UI
* PLAYER RELATED 
- adjust and tweak the dash to dash feel more responsive
- make dash explosion length of sound effect for accurate feel
- implement faster but trickier dash
* ENEMY RELATED
- make a test room with an enemy to try out all enemy movement configs & tweak if necessary
- Adjust enemy aggro in a collision (make it faster / slower in response)
* GAME ROOM
- start sketching and make one tutorial level 
* EXTRA
- look into glow-in-the-dark assets to give the game a better look
